# get-video-link
This small script can quickly return the straight video link by its embed-code (for VK videos)

# Usage
`gvl.sh [quality]`<br>
...then just paste the `"rightclick -> Copy video code"` into stdin.<br>
The script will print the straight placement of this video on the servers,
so you will get the possibility of downloading it.
